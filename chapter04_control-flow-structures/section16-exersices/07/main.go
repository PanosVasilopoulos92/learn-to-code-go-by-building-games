/*
Problem 07* - Guess the number
Write a program which generates a random number in a given range and the user has to guess what number your program has in mind (or in memory, to be more specificâ€¦)

It should read two input numbers from the terminal:
N - the range of numbers to use
X - the number the user has guessed

Then, the program should generate a random number in the range [0, N) and check if the number the user guessed is equal to the number the program generated.
